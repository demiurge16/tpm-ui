### Design patterns and principles

#### Design philosophy

* Don't reinvent the wheel. Use existing libraries and frameworks whenever possible. Try to write as little code as possible.
* Keep it simple. Don't overcomplicate things.
* Keep it clean. Don't write messy code.
* Keep it consistent. Don't write code in different styles. 
* Keep it secure. Don't leave security holes in the application. Always use the latest versions of libraries and frameworks. Think ten times before adding a backdoor.
* Keep it testable. Don't write code that is hard to test. Use pure functions whenever possible. Limit mutation. Don't use global variables.
* Assure observability. Don't write code that is hard to debug. Use logging. Use tracing. Use metrics. Use profiling.
* Use existing standards. Don't invent new ones.
* Use known and proven practices.

#### Domain driven design (DDD)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on the business domain, or the area of expertise that a software system is being built to support. The goal of DDD is to align the technical and business aspects of a project by creating a shared understanding of the problem domain, which allows for more effective communication between developers and stakeholders.

One of the key principles of DDD is the separation of the domain model from the infrastructure. The domain model is the core of the system, and represents the business concepts and rules. The infrastructure includes the technical details of the system, such as the database, web services, and other external systems. By keeping these two areas separate, the domain model can evolve independently of the infrastructure, which allows for more flexibility and scalability in the long-term.

Another important aspect of DDD is the concept of bounded contexts. A bounded context is a specific area of the business that has a clear boundary and a distinct set of concepts and rules. By breaking the system down into smaller, more manageable pieces, the complexity of the system is reduced and it becomes easier to understand and maintain.

DDD also emphasizes the use of ubiquitous language, which is a shared vocabulary that is used by developers and stakeholders to communicate about the domain. By using a common language, misunderstandings and confusion are reduced and the system is easier to understand.

DDD is a powerful approach to software development that can help organizations create better software that aligns with their business goals. It is particularly well-suited for complex systems, where there is a lot of domain knowledge and where the system is expected to evolve over time.

#### Hexagonal architecture (HA) or Ports and adapters

Hexagonal Architecture (HA), also known as the "Ports and Adapters" pattern, is an approach to software design that focuses on separating the core domain logic from the external dependencies. The goal of Hexagonal Architecture is to create a flexible and maintainable system by decoupling the internal workings of the application from the external interfaces.

The central concept of Hexagonal Architecture is the use of ports and adapters. The core domain logic is at the center of the architecture, represented as the "hexagon." This is the business logic of the system, and it should be completely isolated from the external dependencies. The external dependencies, such as databases, web services, and user interfaces, are represented as the "adapters." These adapters connect to the core domain logic through "ports," which are interfaces that define the contract between the core domain logic and the adapters.

One of the key benefits of Hexagonal Architecture is that it makes it easy to change or replace the external dependencies without affecting the core domain logic. For example, if a different database is needed, the adapter can be changed without affecting the rest of the system. Additionally, it makes it easy to test the system by isolating the core domain logic and testing it in isolation.

Another benefit of Hexagonal Architecture is that it enables the core domain logic to be reusable across different contexts. For example, the same core domain logic can be used in a web application, a mobile application, and a command line interface.

Hexagonal Architecture is a powerful approach that can help organizations create more flexible and maintainable systems. It is particularly well-suited for systems that are expected to change over time and for systems that need to be reused in different contexts.

#### Dependency injection (DI)

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows objects to be constructed and their dependencies to be provided externally, rather than hard-coding the dependencies into the object. This makes the objects more flexible, reusable, and testable.

There are several different types of Dependency Injection, including constructor injection, setter injection, and interface injection.

Constructor injection is the most common type of Dependency Injection. It involves passing the dependencies into the constructor of the object when it is created. This ensures that the object has all of the dependencies it needs to function correctly.

Setter injection is similar to constructor injection but instead of passing the dependencies into the constructor, the dependencies are passed in through setter methods after the object is created.

Interface injection is a less common type of Dependency Injection. It involves passing the dependencies through an interface that the object implements. This allows the object to have multiple implementations of the same interface, each with different dependencies.

Dependency Injection has several benefits, including:

It makes objects more flexible and reusable.
It makes it easy to change or replace the dependencies without affecting the object.
It makes it easy to test the object by injecting mock dependencies.
It makes it easy to understand the dependencies of an object by looking at the constructor or setter methods.
It promotes the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by separating the responsibility of creating objects from the responsibility of using them.
Dependency Injection is widely used in modern software development, many frameworks and libraries, such as Spring, Guice, and Dagger, provide built-in support for dependency injection.

Overall, Dependency Injection is a powerful technique that can help developers create more flexible, reusable, and testable code, and make their software more maintainable and easier to understand.

#### Event driven architecture (EDA)

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design pattern that uses events to trigger actions within an application. In an event-driven system, a change in state within the system, such as a user creating a new account, generates an event. This event is then propagated throughout the system, and any interested parties can respond to it.

One of the key benefits of using an event-driven architecture is that it promotes loose coupling between different parts of the system. Instead of components being tightly bound to each other, they can communicate through events, which makes the system more flexible and easier to modify.

Another advantage of EDA is that it allows for asynchronous communication, which can improve performance and scalability. In a traditional, synchronous architecture, a request to one component will block until a response is received. In an event-driven architecture, a request can be made, and the component can continue processing other tasks while waiting for a response.

There are several ways to implement event-driven architecture, such as using a message broker or an event bus. A message broker is a middleware component that routes messages between different parts of the system. An event bus is a simple messaging system that allows components to subscribe to and publish events.

In a translation project management system, event-driven architecture can be used to notify different parts of the system of changes, such as a new translation project being created or a translation being completed. This can trigger actions such as updating the project status or sending a notification to the client.

Overall, event-driven architecture can be a powerful tool for creating a flexible, scalable, and responsive system, and it can be easily integrated with DDD and Hexagonal architecture.

#### Logging and monitoring

Monitoring and logging are essential components of any application, including a translation project management system. They play a critical role in understanding the performance and behavior of the system, as well as identifying and troubleshooting issues.

Logging is the process of recording events and information from the system to a log file, database or other storage medium. This information can include details about user actions, system performance, and error messages. Logs can be used for debugging, auditing, and troubleshooting, as well as for understanding the usage patterns of the system.

Monitoring, on the other hand, is the process of collecting and analyzing performance data from the system. This data can include metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic. Monitoring is used to identify and diagnose performance issues, and to ensure that the system is operating within acceptable parameters.

A translation project management system should log all the translation requests, completed translations, and user actions in a structured format, making it easy to search, analyze, and troubleshoot issues. The system should also monitor various aspects of the system's performance, such as memory usage, CPU usage, and disk space.

By logging and monitoring the system, it will be possible to identify and diagnose issues quickly and easily. Additionally, by analyzing the data, it will be possible to gain insight into the system's performance and usage patterns, which can be used to optimize and improve the system over time.

To achieve these goals, it is recommended to use a centralized log management solution like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), which can collect, parse, index and visualize the log data in real-time. And for monitoring, a tool like Prometheus, InfluxDB or Grafana could be used to collect and visualize metrics data.

#### Combining DDD, HA, DI, EDA and logging/monitoring

Combining Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Hexagonal Architecture (HA), Dependency Injection (DI), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), logging and monitoring can create a powerful and flexible foundation for a translation project management system.

DDD focuses on modeling the business domain and capturing the complexity of the problem domain in a clear and manageable way. By using DDD, the system can be designed in a way that aligns with the business's requirements and better captures the real-world problem it is trying to solve.

HA, on the other hand, provides a way to structure the system in a way that separates the domain logic from the technical infrastructure. This separation of concerns makes the system more flexible, testable and maintainable.

DI allows to manage the dependencies of the system in a decoupled way, reducing the tight coupling and making the system more testable and maintainable.

EDA is a way of designing systems where the communication between components is based on events. This allows for a more reactive, loosely-coupled and scalable architecture.

Logging and monitoring are essential components of any application, including a translation project management system. They play a critical role in understanding the performance and behavior of the system, as well as identifying and troubleshooting issues. A centralized log management solution like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), can collect, parse, index and visualize the log data in real-time, which can be used to gain insight into the system's performance and usage patterns, which can be used to optimize and improve the system over time.

By combining these different architectural and design patterns and strategies, it is possible to create a translation project management system that is flexible, scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand and extend. The system will be more aligned with the business requirements and will have a better ability to adapt to changing requirements over time.

#### Multi-tier architecture

A multi-tier architecture is a common design pattern that separates an application into different layers, each with a specific responsibility. In a translation project management system, this can include a separate UI (User Interface) layer, API (Application Programming Interface) layer, cache layer and data layer.

The UI layer is responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling user input. It can be built using technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and can be rendered on the client-side or server-side.

The API layer serves as an intermediary between the UI and the backend of the system. It handles the communication between the different layers and components, and can be built using technologies such as REST or GraphQL.

The cache layer is responsible for storing and retrieving frequently accessed data, in order to improve the performance of the system by reducing the number of calls to the data layer. This can be implemented using technologies such as Redis or Memcached.

The data layer is responsible for storing, retrieving and manipulating the data used by the system. This can include a relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database such as MongoDB or Cassandra.

By separating the different responsibilities and concerns of the system into different layers, a multi-tier architecture makes the system more modular and easier to understand, test, and maintain. It also allows for better scalability and performance, as each layer can be optimized and scaled separately.

Additionally, this architecture also allows for more flexibility in terms of choosing the technologies that are best suited for each layer. For example, it's possible to use a different technology for the UI layer compared to the data layer, which allows for more adaptability to changing requirements over time.

## Application implementation

### Web technology trends

Technology trends are important when choosing a tech stack because they can have a significant impact on the development, maintenance, and scalability of a project. By staying current with the latest trends, a project can benefit from the latest advancements in technology and tools. For example, choosing a popular framework or language that has a large community can provide access to a wealth of resources and support, making development and troubleshooting easier. Additionally, new trends often bring improved performance, security, and scalability, which can help ensure the success of a project in the long term. Furthermore, a well-established technology stack tends to have more libraries, modules, and tools that can be used to speed up the development process and make it more efficient.

### Chosen stack

#### React with TypeScript, SCSS and Bootstrap

Web technology trends are constantly evolving, with new frameworks and libraries being introduced all the time. Among the popular frameworks and libraries, React has stood out as one of the most widely adopted for building user interfaces. React is a JavaScript library for building reusable UI components and managing the state of the application in an efficient way. It has become popular due to its flexibility, performance, and ease of use.

Another trend that is gaining popularity is the use of TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, which provides optional static typing, class-based object-oriented programming, and other features that make it easier to scale and maintain large codebases. Combining React with TypeScript provides developers with improved code quality, better development experience, and more effective debugging.

SCSS, short for Sassy CSS, is a preprocessor for CSS that enables developers to use variables, functions, and other programming constructs in their stylesheets. This allows for increased code reuse and maintainability, making it easier to manage and scale large CSS codebases. Additionally, Bootstrap, a widely adopted front-end framework, offers a wide range of pre-built UI components, responsive design, and cross-browser compatibility, which can be used in conjunction with React, TypeScript, and SCSS to build responsive and consistent user interfaces.

When it comes to comparing React with other popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as Angular, Vue and Svelte, React stands out for its flexibility and ease of integration. React allows developers to pick and choose the tools and libraries they want to use, whereas Angular, Vue and Svelte come with a more opinionated set of tools and libraries.

In summary, React, TypeScript, SCSS, and Bootstrap are popular web technologies that have proven to be effective in building high-performance, scalable, and maintainable web applications. They provide a powerful combination of features that can help to improve the developer experience and the overall quality of the code. While React may not be the best choice for every use-case, it's flexibility, ease of integration and developer community have made it a popular choice among developers.

#### npm

Npm (short for Node Package Manager) is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language and is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It allows developers to share and reuse code, and manage dependencies in their projects.

Yarn is an alternative package manager for JavaScript, developed by Facebook. It was created to address some of the shortcomings of npm, such as performance and reliability issues. Yarn uses a lockfile and an immutable cache to ensure that installations are deterministic and reliable. Yarn also provides an improved CLI experience, with features such as workspaces and selective version resolutions.

Both npm and Yarn have their own advantages and disadvantages. npm is the default package manager for Node.js and has a larger community and more packages available. Yarn, on the other hand, has a more robust and reliable package management system and is considered to be faster than npm. The choice between the two ultimately comes down to personal preference and the specific requirements of the project.

#### Spring Boot with Kotlin

Kotlin is a programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is fully interoperable with Java. It was developed by JetBrains, the company behind the popular IntelliJ IDEA Java IDE, and was first released in 2011. Kotlin has gained popularity in recent years due to its modern and expressive syntax, improved type inference, and enhanced support for functional programming.

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
